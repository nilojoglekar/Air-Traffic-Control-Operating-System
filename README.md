# Air-Traffic-Control-Operating-System
The aim of this project is to create an air traffic controller. This project contains two
completely different classes, Airport (Base class) and planes (derived class). A set
weight is employed between airports to line between the two. Every airport having an
index and mapped to its name using maps.
Here, we are able to additionally verify the flight cost and it is directly proportional to
the distance.

Air Traffic controllers monitors the activity on the screen by monitoring the aircraft in their
in their allotted airspace by radar and communicate with the pilots. To anticipate collisions,
Air Traffic Control implements activity partition rules.
The main Purpose of maintaining this system is to reduce manual errors and making it
convenience for all party involve.
